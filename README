=== Installation instructions ===

== Requirements ==
* PHP 5.2.0+
* The MySQLi extension
* Shell exec privileges

== Configuration ==
* Configuration is set in php/config.inc.php

== File structure ==
* A checkout of the CVS module named doc-editor
  - cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout doc-editor
* A copy of the jpgraph 2.x series
  - Download from here: http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/jpdownload.php
  - Unpack it like so: doc-editor/jpgraph/
* A copy of the ExtJs 2.2.x series
  - Download from here: http://extjs.com/products/extjs/download.php
  - Unpack it like so: doc-editor/extjs/
  - Note: extjs does not unzip into a new directory by default, so beware
* Make sure the data directory has read/write permissions for the web server user
  - Default data directory location: doc-editor/data

== The Database ==
* Create a MySQL database as per config.inc.php
* Import doc-editor.sql into this new database
* Setup configuration options inside config.inc.php

== Initial (first) run ==
* Execute scripts/firstRun.php either in the browser or via CLI
  It will take a long time to execute, as it performs the following duties:
  - Applies tools such as revcheck, doc_check, and error_check
  - Checks out the phpdoc-all CVS module into the data directory

=== Other notes ===
* A common test PHP CVS user is: cvsread with password: phpfi
* Or use your own CVS credentials
