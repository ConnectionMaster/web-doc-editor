GENERAL:
========

* Dedicate a wiki page to the doc-editor (and move this TODO there)
* Take a decision once and for all about the app name, and its spelling
* Take a decision about the license, and update all the files accordingly
* Allow use for other systems
  - Other PHP Projects (peardoc, gtkdocs, php-src/README*, phpweb/reST/)
  - Other VCS Systems (SVN, GIT)
  - Generic projects (not php.net related)

CVS2SVN:
====
  - svn diff failed due to different in revision numbering scheme (see File.php getinfo)
  - svn diff failed due to cvs2svn diff info lost
  - using svn native-client over HTTP may sometimes fail and need to redo the operation

PHP:
====

* Security
  - Fix XSS holes
  - Redo the folder tree to keep classes and data out of web server reach (can we do this in mod_rewrite?)

* Translation Status
  - At the current time, the french translation graph is useless/unreadable. We need to find
    a better way to display the information

* Automatic upgrade
  - Add an automatic system to upgrade dataBase (when it's needed) uppon the application version number. (idea by Richard Quadling, crontab?)

JAVASCRIPT:
===========

* Implement RTL where appropriate
* Generalize Diff?? cvs-log-diff, cvs-file-diff, patch-file-diff, pending-commit-file-diff
* adjust diff-panel id convention to prevent mixing different diff-panel

USER INTERFACE:
===============

* Main Interface
  - Get rid of the "Main Menu" and put the buttons on the header

* Add support and tools for specific markup types
  - DocBook
  - ReST
  - PO files (gettext)

* Implement WYSIWYG
  - using XSLT for rendering? (inspired by http://beacon.kix.in/)

BUGS:
=====

* Saving patch / file
  - when a file is saved, file.new is created. when a patch is saved, file.new is replaced by file.###.patch
    Some ui component may issue a diff between file & file.new but sometimes file.new is removed as .patch

* reopening file-diff (context-menu diff) in main-panel tab crashes extjs

* Translator vcs account parsing failed
  - check php parsing scripts
