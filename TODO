GENERAL:
========

* Dedicate a wiki page to the doc-editor (and move this TODO there)
* Take a decision once and for all about the app name, and its spelling
* Take a decision about the license, and update all the files accordingly
* Use the $Revision$ keyword (in comments, about popup, ..)

PHP:
====

* Security
  - Fix XSS holes
  - Redo the folder tree to keep classes and data out of web server reach

* Clean up class.php
  - Create a DocumentationFile class which will handle all the parsing task
  - Create a TranslationStatus class which will compute the translation
    status by comparing DocumentationFile objects
  - Create a DocumentationCheck class which will perform all the tests against
    the en/ tree (and other languages? we _should_ be able to rely on TranslationStatus
    on its own
  - Create a CvsClient class to handle all the CVS operations (fsockopen() and exec())
  - Create a BugReader class
  - Create a NewsReader class

* Controller
  - Implement Apache rewriting to have controller actions look like http://foo.com/do/task/?arg=val
  - Clean up the action names (and reflect the changes in main.js)

* Translation Status
  - At the current time, the french translation graph is useless/unreadable. We need to find
    a better way to display the information
 
* Implement i18n

JAVASCRIPT:
===========

* Clean up the namespaces
* Implement i18n
* Split main.js to several objects & files (to be discussed)

USER INTERFACE:
===============

* Login page
  - Enable/disable the submit button regarding the Form validation state (bindForm: true?)
